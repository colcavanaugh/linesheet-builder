# Planning our classic line sheet layout

## Organizational principles

1. By product type (ring, bracelet, chain, etc.)
    We want to be able to choose the order of product types listed in the line sheet builder web interfact.

2. Within product type, go in order of SKU number
    For example, R-001-SS is followed by R-002-SS, etc.

3. Show separate entries for each type of metal a given piece is available in - as each metal version will have its own photo and wholesale price.

## Layout

### Components

1. Cover page
2. Table of contents/spreadsheet view of products
3. Product catalog

### Cover page

Branding, document title, brand statement (brief description, 1-3 sentences), and instructions on placing orders and contacting the team.

### TOC/Spreadsheet

1. Header: top 20%, left-aligned.
    Table of Contents

2. Body: next 70%, left-aligned.
    List products by type, alongside SKU, metal, wholesale price, and page number.

    Each product type should be its own clearly delineated section. So, rather than having a single, continuous TOC/spreadsheet describing every product in the catalog, the TOC will have section headers that break up the data corresponding to each product type (Rings, Bracelets, etc.).

3. Footer: last 10%.
    Page number (will be page 1: cover page will be counted as page 0)

### Product catalog

1. Header: top 20%, left-aligned.
    [Product Type], [Section Page #]
    i.e.: Rings, page 1

2. Body: next 70%, center-aligned.
    Four product cards, each with product image and details in square layout.

    Use same product card layout as line sheet builder web page application (two versions: one for landscape image, one for portrait).

2. Footer: bottom 10%, right-aligned.
    Overall catalog page number.
